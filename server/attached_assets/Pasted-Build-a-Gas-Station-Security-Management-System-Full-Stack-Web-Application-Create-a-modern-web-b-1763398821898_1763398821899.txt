Build a Gas Station Security Management System - Full-Stack Web Application

Create a modern web-based security management system for gas stations with two main features:

Feature 1: Video Clip Review System
Display security camera video clips (10-second clips from gas station cameras)
Each clip has 3 classification buttons:
"Suspect" - needs further review
"Confirm Theft" - verified shoplifting incident
"Clear" - false alarm, no issue
Video clips will be automatically sent from cameras to the system (simulate with upload endpoint for now)
Show status badges on each clip (Pending/Suspect/Confirmed/Clear)
Feature 2: Customer Recognition & Points System
Use facial recognition AI (AWS Rekognition or similar service) to identify people in video clips
Automatically track customer visits with point system:
Each time a customer appears on camera = +1 point
Display total points for each customer
Badge system: "New Customer" (less than 5 points) vs "Regular Customer" (5+ points)
Show customer profile: name, total points, first seen date, last seen date
Live customer feed showing recently recognized visitors
User Roles (Different Dashboards):
Gas Station Manager - Can review clips and mark them (Suspect/Confirm/Clear)
AI Trainer - Same as Manager PLUS additional controls for managing training data, bulk actions, advanced filters
Technical Requirements:
Full-stack JavaScript application
React frontend with clean, modern UI
Express/Node.js backend
PostgreSQL database with tables:
video_clips - stores clip metadata, status, face detections
customers - face_id, name, points, visit tracking
reviews - manager decisions on clips
Role-based authentication (Manager vs AI Trainer)
Include 5-6 sample 10-second video clips for demonstration
Important Notes:
Design the upload endpoint to receive clips from camera systems automatically
Keep accumulating customer points indefinitely (no limit)
Build both features simultaneously
Use real facial recognition API (will provide API key separately)
Build a complete working prototype with sample data included.
